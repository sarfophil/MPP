Firstly, the method 'contains(e)' which is found inside the listsAreEqual
makes use of java.util method Objects.equals(o,e) to make comparison which determines
equality by the "equals" of the first argument. In this context, equals is not overridden in the Employee
class for the comparison. Also Employee class is error prone because there exist an equals method which will
continue to be invoked when we introduce object version of equals.
Therefore,We need to remove the equals method and override the Object's version of equals and hashCode methods
